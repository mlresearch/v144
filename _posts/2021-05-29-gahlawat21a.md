title: Contraction L1-Adaptive Control using Gaussian Processes
abstract: " We present a control framework that enables safe simultaneous learning
  and control for systems subject to uncertainties. The two main constituents are
  contraction theory-based $\\mathcal{L}_1$-adaptive ($\\mathcal{CL}_1$) control and
  Bayesian learning in the form of Gaussian process (GP) regression. The $\\mathcal{CL}_1$
  controller ensures that control objectives are met while providing safety certificates.
  Furthermore, the controller incorporates any available data into GP models of uncertainties,
  which improves performance and enables the motion planner to achieve optimality
  safely. This way, the safe operation of the system is always guaranteed, even during
  the learning transients."
