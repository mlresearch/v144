title: Learning Recurrent Neural Net Models of Nonlinear Systems
abstract: 'We consider the following learning problem: Given sample pairs of input
  and output signals generated by an unknown nonlinear system (which is not assumed
  to be causal or time-invariant), we wish to find a continuous-time recurrent neural
  net with hyperbolic tangent activation function that approximately reproduces the
  underlying i/o behavior with high confidence. Leveraging earlier work concerned
  with matching output derivatives up to a given finite order, we reformulate the
  learning problem in familiar system-theoretic language and derive quantitative guarantees
  on the sup-norm risk of the learned model in terms of the number of neurons, the
  sample size, the number of derivatives being matched, and the regularity properties
  of the inputs, the outputs, and the unknown i/o map.'
